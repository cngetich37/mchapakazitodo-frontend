## Development Workflow

Here's how you can contribute to the project:

1. **Pick an issue**: Browse through the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mchapakazitodo/mchapakazitodo-frontend/issues) to find a task or bug to work on. If you have an idea for a new feature or bug fix, create a new issue first to discuss it with the maintainers and the community.

2. **Create a branch**: Create a new branch for your work with a descriptive name. For example:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-new-feature
   ```

3. **Make your changes**: Write your code and follow the project's coding style and guidelines.

4. **Commit your changes**: Please write meaningful commit messages and follow the [conventional commit format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This helps maintain a clean commit history.

5. **Push your changes**: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/add-new-feature
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the [main project repository](https://github.com/mchapakazitodo/mchapakazitodo-frontend) and create a Pull Request from your branch. Fill in the PR template with details about your changes and what issues it addresses.

7. **Code Review**: The maintainers and the community will review your PR. Make sure to address any feedback and keep the discussion constructive.

8. **Merge**: Once your PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the main branch.

## Testing

Make sure to write tests for your code and ensure that all existing tests pass before submitting a Pull Request. You can run tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

## Submitting Changes

Please follow these guidelines when submitting changes:

- Make sure your code is well-documented and follows the project's coding standards.
- Squash your commits into a single coherent commit with a clear message.
- Update the README or documentation if your changes affect it.
- Include a reference to the relevant issue or PR in your commit message.
